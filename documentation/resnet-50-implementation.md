# ResNet 50 Implementation

**1. Importing Necessary Libraries**

```python
import os
import json
import torch
from torch import nn, optim
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader, random_split
from torchvision import models, transforms
from PIL import Image
```

The script begins by importing the necessary Python libraries. This includes:

* `os` and `json` for interacting with the file system and handling JSON files respectively.
* Various PyTorch (`torch`) libraries for building and training the neural network model.
* The `torchvision` library which is a part of PyTorch, provides popular datasets, model architectures, and common image transformations for computer vision.
* `PIL` (Python Imaging Library, known as `Pillow` in its modern version) for opening and manipulating images.

**2. Defining Custom Dataset Class**

```python
class CustomDataset(Dataset):
    ...
```

Here, a custom PyTorch `Dataset` class is defined to handle the loading and pre-processing of images and their corresponding labels. In this class:

* The `__init__` function initializes the class with the path of the image and annotation folders and an optional transformation to apply to the images.
* The `__len__` function returns the total number of samples in the dataset.
* The `__getitem__` function loads and returns an image-label pair from the dataset, given an index.

**3. Preprocessing and Data Splitting**

```python
train_transform = ...
train_dataset = CustomDataset(...
train_size = int(0.8 * len(train_dataset))
val_size = len(train_dataset) - train_size
train_dataset, val_dataset = random_split(train_dataset, [train_size, val_size])
```

Here, the images are preprocessed using transformations (resizing, conversion to PyTorch tensors, and normalization), and the dataset is split into a training set (80% of the data) and a validation set (20% of the data).

**4. Creating DataLoaders**

```python
batch_size = 32
train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)
val_loader = DataLoader(val_dataset, batch_size=batch_size)
```

DataLoaders for the training and validation datasets are created. These DataLoaders provide an efficient way to iterate through the datasets in mini-batches.

**5. Model Definition**

```python
model = models.resnet50(pretrained=True)
num_features = model.fc.in_features
model.fc = nn.Linear(num_features, 5)
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model = model.to(device)
```

A pre-trained ResNet50 model is loaded, and the final fully connected layer is modified to have 5 output features, corresponding to the 5 types of charts. The model is then transferred to the GPU if one is available, otherwise it will run on the CPU.

**6. Defining Loss Function and Optimizer**

```python
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
```

The CrossEntropyLoss function is used as the loss criterion, and the Adam optimizer is used for optimizing the model parameters.

**7. Training the Model**

```python
num_epochs = 10
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    ...
```

The model is trained for a specified number of epochs. In each epoch, the model parameters are updated based on the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters.

**8. Model Validation**

```python
with torch.no_grad():
    ...
    print(f'Epoch {epoch+1}/{num_epochs}, Accuracy

: {100 * correct / total}')
```

After each epoch, the model is validated on the validation set. The accuracy of the model on the validation set is then printed.

This script provides a fairly standard structure for training a deep learning model on a custom dataset with PyTorch.
